              Sensitive skin types may show characteristics of dry, oily, and
              combination skin types but they can also be subject to redness and
              irritation. Sensitive skin can be a product of skin conditions,
              but that is not always the case.

              Those with combination skin types have characteristics of two or
              more types of skin. These skin types often have to use different
              types of products for various parts of the face and body.
