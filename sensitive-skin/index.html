        This is a short video by cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Sam Bunting. She is
        based in London, UK and makes videos on how to take care of different
        types of skin. She also has her own brand and shop.

        Sensitive skin types may show characteristics of dry, oily, and
        combination skin types but they can also be subject to redness and
        irritation. Those with sensitive skin often have skin conditions such as
        rosacea and eczema, or even severe allergies. Those with sensitive skin
        need to take extra cautions with their skin, as many products and
        ingredients can easily irritate you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dermatologist Leslie Baumman says that people with sensitive skin should
        avoid friction, excessive heat and triggers like alcohol or stress.
        Other experts also see overlapping with sensitive and dry skin types, as
        both are prone to redness and irritation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sensitive skin can also be a result of overexfoliating, overscrubbing,
        and using harsh products.
      </p>

        “Most skin, if you use the right products, is not as sensitive as you
        think it is,” Dr. Doris Day, founder of Day Dermatology and Aesthetics,
        said.
