      <h2>Taking Care of Combination and Sensitive Skin Types</h2>
      <p>
        Based on your skin type, there are different approaches that you should
        take if you want to improve the condition of your skin. Here, you will
        learn about how to take care of sensitive and combination skin types!
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> Here are some tips on how to take care of your sensitive skin:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Take short 5 to 10 minute showers with warm — not hot — water</li>
        <li>Avoid harsh astringents and exfoliants</li>
        <li>Use a gentle, fragrance-free soap</li>
        <li>Use essential oils instead of perfumes</li>
        <li>Use a gentle, fragrance-free laundry detergent</li>
        <li>Try using organic cleaning supplies</li>
        <li>Always use a shaving cream or gel</li>
        <li>
          Gently pat yourself dry after a shower (instead of rubbing) and apply
          moisturizer right away
        </li>
        <li>
          Test new products on a discreet area of skin at least one day before
          trying a full-application
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Here are some tips on how to take care of your combination skin:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Be sure to ditch any harsh cleansers you own – These cleansers
          completely strip everything from your skin and will completely destroy
          the drier patches on your cheeks and elsewhere. Stick to a gentle
          cleanser and use it morning and night to keep your oil under control
          without being overly-stripping.
        </li>
        <li>
          Exfoliate to get rid of the dead skin around your T-zone – Just ensure
          you don’t do this too often! Once a week or so is plenty.
        </li>
        <li>
          Blot away any excess oil that pops up throughout the day – This will
          keep your face looking perfect all day while also cutting down on the
          likelihood of breakouts, blackheads, whiteheads, and more.
        </li>
        <li>
          Beyond anything, use a good moisturizer! – You might think that your
          oil zones might mean you are exempt from this step, but you definitely
          are not. A good, light moisturizer will go a long way to keeping your
          drier skin hydrated without overhydrating your oiler areas.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <div class="panel inside">
          <p>
            Skin type is determined by various genetic and external factors. For
            example, genetics determines how much oil your face produces, as
            well as any skin conditions you have. However, factors like the
            weather and what you use on your face also influence your skin
            condition.

        <button class="faq button">
          What does it mean when my skin fits the criteria of more than one
          type?
        </button>
        <div class="panel inside">
          <p>
            Depending on external factors, your skin type can change! For
            example, some people will have oily skin during the summer and dry
            skin during the winter. Most people will not fit a single skin type
            description exactly. You might also have combination skin type.

          How do I know if a product is working?
        </button>
        <div class="panel inside">
          <p>
            Many experts recommend you do a patch test (testing a product on
            your hand first) to see if you have any inflammatory response before
            using a product.
