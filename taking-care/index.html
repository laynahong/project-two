        <p>
          Skin type is determined by various genetic and external factors. For
          example, genetics determines how much oil your face produces, as well
          as any skin conditions you have. However, factors like the weather and
          what you use on your face also influence your skin condition.

      <button class="faq button">
        What does it mean when my skin fits the criteria of more than one type?
      </button>
      <div class="panel inside">
        <p>
          Depending on external factors, your skin type can change! For example,
          some people will have oily skin during the summer and dry skin during
          the winter. Most people will not fit a single skin type description
          exactly. You might also have combination skin type.

      <button class="faq button">How do I know if a product is working?</button>
      <div class="panel inside">
        <p>
          Many experts recommend you do a patch test (testing a product on your
          hand first) to see if you have any inflammatory response before using
          a product.
