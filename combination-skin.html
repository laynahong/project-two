          This graphic from <i>Cherie.com</i> shows some of the indicators that
          you might have combination skin.

      <p>
        Those with combination skin types have characteristics of two or more
        types of skin. These skin types often have to use different types of
        products for various parts of the face and body. Combination skin is
        commonly described as being oily around the T-Zone (forehead, chin, and
        nose) and dry around the cheeks. Combination skin is also described as
        changing based on the seasons; for example, your skin could be oily
        during the summer and dry during the winter. However, there is no true
        definition for this skin type and it can mean different things for
        everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        This skintype can be confusing at times, as the way that the skin
        behaves is often inconsistent. In general, skintype is determined by
        many factors, such as genetics, hormone levels, and environmental
        factors.
      </p>

      <p><b>Some signs that you might have combination skin include: </b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Your t-zone is oily while other areas are dry – </b> This is the
          most common identifier for combination skin. The areas might vary from
          each individual.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Your t-zone has larger pores – </b> Those with combination skin
          have a more oil t-zone compared to dry or normal skin. This means that
          your pores are bigger and more visible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>You have dandruff – </b> While not inherently tied with combination
          skin, many with this skin type also see a similar pattern on their
          scalp. Dandruff then crops up as some areas are naturally drier and
          flakier than others.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Your cheeks feel tight after washing – </b> This is a big indicator
          that you have combination skin, as it shows the differeing amounts of
          oil your skin produces. If this happens after washing your face, you
          probably noticed that your cheeks get flaky without moisturizer while
          other areas don’t seem to need extra help.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Your acne is mostly concentrated around the T-zone – </b> Extra oil
          and blocked pores means acne. If you experience the vast majority of
          your acne on your forehead or chin, or the majority of your blackheads
          around your nose, you probably have combination skin.
        </li>
